# College-Events-Hub


This project is a web application designed for a college community, allowing both regular users (college students, faculty, etc.) and admin users to interact with the system in different capacities.

Features for Regular Users (College Users):

User Authentication: Regular users can register and log in to the system.
Event Viewing: After logging in, regular users can view upcoming events happening in the college.
Student Information Search: Regular users can search for information about other students using various filters (such as name, course, etc.).
Features for Admin Users:

Admin Authentication: Admin users have separate login credentials to access the admin panel.
Event Management: Admin users can add new events to the system through the admin panel. These events will be visible to regular users.
Student Information Access: Admin users might have additional privileges to access student information or manage user accounts.
